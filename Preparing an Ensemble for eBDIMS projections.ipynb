    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "  In (Orellana et al. 2016) we have used all the crystal structures of a protein to create an ensemble. What we call an ensemble in this article is a set of structures that are not chimeric, represent the whole protein rather than a single domain of it, and do not contain more than 5 consecutive non-terminal missing residues. As much as we would like to automate this process, preparation of an ensemble often requires manual intervention due to problems like, chimeric constructs or the placement of subunits clockwise vs. anticlockwise. There is also the decision to be made whether to exclude a structure that has missing residues that are not terminal. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  While preparing the ensembles for the article, we have taken care of those problems manually and made a decision to repair the structures  if it was known to represent an important state which does not have any other representatives. Altough it very much depends on the structure, whether there are other structures in a similar state to be used as template or where the missing residues are located, we recommend repairing structures with less than 6 consecutive residues missing. There is an example modeller script that can be used to repair structures.  It is upto the user to fix and include them in the ensemble later.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This tutorial will be using GLIC as an example. Because this was most challenging ensemble we prepared for this study, it highlights the potential issues the users likely to encounter. "

    "### Requirements\n",
    "  Before we get started make sure you have installed the pdbParser package and the other required python packages. If you have used pip, it should take care of the requirements for you. But if you run into problems you can find the information on the github page.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  To determine the missing residues, pdbParser relies on sequence alignment. If you use pdbParser to prepare a start and an end structure for eBDIMs then the alignment is generated via BioPython. However if you are preparing an ensemble you must install Clustal Omega or run the provided fasta sequence through a multiple sequence alignment tool and save the alignment in fasta format. The installation of Clustal Omega can easily be done via conda. After you install it you should provide the path for the clustal executable, if it is not in your path already.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Altough not a requirement, if you want to fix any broken structures you will need a modelling program. We have provided an example script for modeller."

    "### Obtaining PDB Files\n",
    "  It can be daunting to find all the available PDB files, and which chains actually belongs to your protein, which are not just antibodies or other things. The easiset way to do this is to go through the UniProtKB database and this tutorial requires the UniProt ID. ![title](img/uniprot_ini_search.png)\n",
    "After finding the UniProt ID you can run the commands below to download the PDB file. Besides the UniProt ID, you also have to provide the total number of chains that are in a biological assembly. Heteromeric structures require a different routine which are not yet supported in pdbParser. However similar logic applies in preperation of such an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To download these structures in a different location, you can also provide an argument with an absolute path. Otherwise the commands will the current working directory for downloading files and writing outputs."
